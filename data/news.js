      linkedin: `Dario Amodei just gave every software engineer a 6–12 month warning.

At Davos 2026, the Anthropic CEO said it plainly:

"We might be 6 to 12 months away from when AI models are doing most — maybe all — of what software engineers do."

His own engineers at Anthropic are already saying:

"I'm writing less code. I'm mostly just directing the AI now."

Here's what most people are missing:

This isn't about AI being good at coding.

This is about the role of a software engineer fundamentally changing.

This isn't a "someday" problem.

It's a "by end of this year" problem.

The question isn't whether AI will write most of the code.

The question is whether the people managing it are ready.

Are you building skills to direct AI — or still optimizing for writing it yourself?

      twitter: `Anthropic's CEO at Davos: "AI will do most — maybe all — of software engineering in 6–12 months."

His own engineers already say they're directing AI more than writing code.

The shift isn't coming. It's here.
